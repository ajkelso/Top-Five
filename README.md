# Top5

Top5 is a Single Page Application with a Ruby on Rails API backend and a Javascript/React/Redux frontend for the person addicted to making Top 5 lists (or maybe just the avid High Fidelity fan)! Top5 helps you create and keep track of your own Top Fives while seeing whatâ€™s the most popular of each category for all fellow list makers!

## Installation

To use this app, clone the repo, navigate into the backend folder, run `bundle install`, run `rake db:migrate`, and `rails s`.  Then, navigate to the frontend folder, run `npm install` then `npm start`.
Everything should be set up!
